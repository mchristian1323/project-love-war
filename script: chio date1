Leaving the school for the day he walks to the sports park. He sees Chio in a wide field holding a Frisbee.
Chio: 
-Oh hey! I hoped you’d come around soon!

Protagonist:
1.	Yep I’m here for training
2.	Yeah, it’s a good day to walk through the park

Chio: 
-Oh yes with the warm sun on our back
-Its makes the day perfect for both

Both walk down the jogging path around the park

Chio:
I’ve noticed that your social skills more or less lack any luster
So as your friend I want to help your social awkwardness
The first thing you should do is listen to what the other person is saying.
Like watching every little movement of the opponent,
You can read their intentions like a well laid maneuver.
 The second is patience. 
Patience lead to understanding.
Hey you following me here?

Protagonist:
1.	Not at all
2.	Yeah of course
3.	YES COACH!


Chio
1.	Come on seriously? That’s like the first lesson…
2.	Good, now the third lesson…
3.	Haha Excellent Spirit!

Their walking suddenly stops with loud dubsteps 

Chio:
Oh no not them! Not Now!
I’ve have no time for them!

A group of people in dark baggy street clothes, running around and jumping over everything

Chio:
Parkour flash mob!
RUN!

They both start running for their lives until Chio gets shoved to the ground 

Chio:
Ahh my leg its sprained!

The Protagonist thinks quick and carries chio to safety and parkours chase hem up and down the park
MINI GAME BREAK
 Protagonist reaches a resting point near a man-made pond 
Chio: HEY WILL YOU PUT ME DOWN ALREADY?!



Protagonist 
1.Gently let her down on a bench
2. Slow let her down on the ground
3.Drop her 

Chio:
1.	Thank you..
2.	Ok, not what I had in mind but thanks
3.	Ahh What the heck is wrong with you!   

Protagonist 
1.	Are you ok?
2.	Damn kids and their stepdubs!
3.	What was that all about?

Chio:
	1.Yeah Im Ok now. Damn Flashcorers!  
	2.???
	3. It happen from time to time

	   As you can tell, they are not a pleasant bunch
Thank you for helping me out back there
You ran from them well
You actually could do well in sports haha
Which brings me to the third thought.
Complementing every now and again helps too!
But why don’t we try continuing our social lesson later
Its been a day.
..Could you help me back home?
 AND DON’T HOLD ME!
